abstract = "Social network analysis is at the intersection of multiple fields. Historically, it is tightly related to sociology, psychology, mathematics, anthropology, and network science. It also forms the basis for using open source intelligence (OSINT) to uncover key individuals who operate criminal networks. In this chapter, basic techniques in graph theory and analysis are presented for OSINT, and a Twitter case study is outlined."

abstract="Bitcoin is a distributed digital currency which has attracted a substantial number of users. We perform an in-depth investigation to understand what made Bitcoin so successful, while decades of research on cryptographic e-cash has not lead to a large-scale deployment. We ask also how Bitcoin could become a good candidate for a long-lived stable currency. In doing so, we identify several issues and attacks of Bitcoin, and propose suitable techniques to address them.",
